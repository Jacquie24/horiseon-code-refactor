# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
The goal was to take a look at Horiseon's existing webpage and refactor the code to ensure it meets web accessibility standards while still maintaining the overall appearance of the webpage, as they were happy with the structure.

The finished webpage has the look and feel of the previous webpage.  However the elements and tags have been changed to conform with Semantic HTML for accessibility.  In addition, I was able to fix a broken link and clean up some of the CSS language so the page will load more smoothly.  

For example, in the initial screenshot of the page, I had noticed that the main image was actually repeating onto itself, which could cause some confusion to a screen reader, so I put in a no-repeat to make sure the viewer is only being told about the image once.

To see the final result, you can view the webpage live at [horiseon-code-refactor](https://jacquie24.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/).

## Usage
This is a fairly simple webpage. However, there are three links on the top nav bar.  By clicking on any of the three, it will move the page down to the corresponding box with a detailed description of that service.
