# horiseon-code-refactor

## The Project
The goal was to take a look at Horiseon's existing webpage and refactor the code to ensure it meets web accessibility standards while still maintaining the overall appearance of the webpage, as they were happy with the structure.

## The Results
The finished webpage has the look and feel of the previous webpage.  However the elements and tags have been changed to conform with Semantic HTML for accessibility.  In addition, I was able to fix a broken link and clean up some of the CSS language so the page will load more smoothly.  

For example, in the initial screenshot of the page, I had noticed that the main image was actually repeating onto itself, which could cause some confusion to a screen reader, so I put in a no-repeat to make sure the viewer is only being told about the image once.

Here is the final result.
